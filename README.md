`btester` is a Python framework optimized for running backtests on multiple assets and supports full portfolio backtesting. It provides tools for backtesting trading strategies based on historical market data. The framework includes classes for managing financial positions, completed trades, and a flexible abstract base class for implementing custom trading strategies.

## Installation

You can install `btester` using pip. Simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install btester
```

## Usage

1. Define your custom trading strategy by creating a class that inherits from the `Strategy` abstract class.

2. Implement the required methods in your custom strategy: `init` for initialization and `next` for the core strategy logic.

3. Instantiate the `Backtest` class with your custom strategy, historical market data, and other parameters.

4. Run the backtest using the `run` method, which returns a `Result` object containing backtest results.

## Classes

### `Position` Class

Represents an open financial position with attributes such as symbol, open date, open price, and current value. It allows for updating the position based on the latest market data.

### `Trade` Class

Represents a completed financial transaction, including details like symbol, open and close dates, open and close prices, position size, profit/loss, and trade commission.

### `Result` Class

A container class holding the results of a backtest, including returns, a list of trades, and a list of open positions.

### `Strategy` Class (Abstract Base Class)

An abstract base class that defines the structure for implementing trading strategies. It includes methods for initialization, the core strategy logic, opening positions, and closing positions.

### `Backtest` Class

Responsible for running a backtest on a given strategy using historical market data.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example usage of the btester
from btester import Strategy, Backtest
import pandas as pd

# Define a custom strategy by inheriting from the abstract Strategy class
class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        # Custom initialization logic for the strategy
        pass

    def next(self, i: int, record: Dict[Hashable, Any]):
        # Custom strategy logic for each time step
        pass

# Load historical market data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Initialize and run the backtest
backtest = Backtest(strategy=MyStrategy, data=data, cash=10000, commission=0.01)
result = backtest.run()

# Access backtest results
returns_series = result.returns
completed_trades = result.trades
remaining_positions = result.open_positions
```
